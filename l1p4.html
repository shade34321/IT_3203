			The first site I'll critique is SPSU's IT Site located <a href="http://spsu.edu/itdegrees/index.htm" alt="SPSU IT Home">here</a>.<br />

			For a while it was a hassle for me to find me way to this site, always had to google for it, from the SPSU's website. Usually when I was coming to this site I was looking for the the classes I need to take to graduate - the flowcharts. I could never find it unless I used google to locate it. Since then it has been changed and I can now easily find it. This relates to Nielsen's list item 10. In regards to Nielsen's point 2 I don't think that's as much of an issue anymore. I use Google Chrome as my primary web browser and if I click PDF link it just opens it. I can then decide if I want it or not and does not disrupt my flow in any way. Now I did have a problem previously even with the build in PDF readers since they were so slow. Now these flow charts I was referencing above are stored as a PDF and why I bring this up. Another issue I have with this site relates to Nielsen's point 3 - none of the links I click actually change color. While for this viewing it didn't bother me but previously when I was looking for stuff it was hard for me to figure out where I went and where I came from all the time.

			The second site I'll critique is <a href="lifehacker.com" alt="Lifehacker">Lifehacker</a>.<br  />

			I used to visit this site quite a bit but I haven't really in the past year. Though of no fault of theirs, Google Reader was decommissioned. The site violates or embraces a few of Nielsen's points, primarily 1, 4, 6, 7, and 9. Though some of these are debatable. We'll start with the knowns - 1, 6, and 9. Most of Lifehackers articles are from other places and they provide the link for them so the original author can get credit. These links open up a new browser. Though IMHO it is better this way since sometimes you'll read a great write up and want to either continue reading the article or what not but you don't want to stop viewing lifehacker. So you click the link and continue your browsing on Lifehacker. Both 1 and 6 are related and only if you're looking for something extremely specific. I've read a few articles on lifehacker and later on I'll remember them and want to go back and reuse whatever the article was about. Most of the time I can not find it unless it was really recent or I used thier built in search function. If I use thier built in search function then I usually have to get really specific or I'll get a mass of results. The points 7 is debatable on whether or not it is violated. For the most part the entire site looks like an advertisement, some stuff is bigger, and it's really bright and colorful. It's also quite condensed on the front page  and thus hard to see from afar that they are actual articles. Now the good point 4 they make great use of making sure their text is scannable. They appropriately use headers, highlight words, and the layout to give you and overview of what's there - if you have been there before. From their to the actual article it gets even better.

			The third site I'll critique is <a href="https://www.google.com" alt="Google">Google</a>.<br />

			Google's home page is rather simple and I love it for this. You have a text box and two bottuns. Overall the list doesn't have anything on Google since I can't think of a way they violate any of these. In one area though that they excel is point 8. Everything is consisten on Google's home page. If you're looking for something you type it in the text box and click either search or "I'm feeling lucky" and it does what is expected of it. I did just realize one thing that is a bit weird but makes perfect sense. Usually the company link is a link back to the home page. On Google's home page this is not so since you're already there. Though if you go to search their logo does become a hyperlink.

			The last site I'll critique is <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/" alt="Nielsen Norman Group">Nielsen Norman Group</a>. The site the list is on originally.<br />
			
			So I've never heard of this site or group before so I decided to do some searching on them and since I'm using them to critique other sites lets see if they follow their own rules. The first thing I noticed was when I clicked on the navigation bar the links did not change color but the current site you were on remained underlined. When your mouse rolled over the various other links they would underline in a slightly different red color thus you were able to distinguish between where you wanted to go and where you currently at. While I searched for them I used thier built in search to search for this list we were using. It came back second, after 10 Good deeds in Web Design. How that relates I'm unsure. Though it was first link on a google search so that was good. Overall the site allowed you to scan to find what you were looking for but once you got to the articles, while still logically split up for quick and easy scanning provided more text which you had to read. So overall I think they do a good job of following their own list which is great!
