			So for in web design I haven't really learned anything new but I'm new to your class so hopefully that will change! Though since I've started taking this class I've improved my CSS knowledge.

			I've also learned more javascript and I've used it a bit at work writing a few windows scripts. I've also learned how to use javascript to make sites "dynamic".

			Before I left Professor White's class I had read the chapter on PHP. I realized that PHP is almost exactly like Perl which I have to use a lot of at work. This is the part I'm most excited about this semester, I've been wanting to learn PHP for a while but just haven't been able to find time to do it.
